# MemoryKeeper Accessibility Audit

## Overview
This document outlines the accessibility audit for the MemoryKeeper application, ensuring WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. The audit covers all major components and identifies areas for improvement.

## Audit Results

### 1. Semantic HTML Structure
✅ **PASS** - The application uses proper semantic HTML elements:
- Proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, etc.)
- Semantic elements like `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<button>`, etc.
- Logical structure and content organization

### 2. ARIA Labels and Attributes
✅ **PASS** - Most interactive elements have appropriate ARIA attributes:
- `aria-label` for icon-only buttons
- `aria-current` for active navigation items
- `aria-hidden` for decorative elements
- Screen reader-only text for context (`sr-only` class)

### 3. Keyboard Navigation
⚠️ **PARTIAL** - Basic keyboard navigation is implemented:
- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Focus indicators are present for most elements
- Logical tab order follows visual layout

**Issues Identified:**
- Some complex components may need enhanced focus management
- Modal dialogs could benefit from focus trapping

### 4. Color Contrast
✅ **PASS** - Color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA requirements:
- Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text
- Minimum 3:1 contrast ratio for large text
- Sufficient contrast for interactive elements

### 5. Text Alternatives
✅ **PASS** - Text alternatives are provided:
- Descriptive labels for all functional images
- Meaningful text for icon buttons
- Proper alt text for informative images

### 6. Form Accessibility
✅ **PASS** - Forms are accessible:
- Proper labeling of form inputs
- Error identification and suggestions
- Logical grouping of related form elements

- Trap focus within modals
- Return focus to triggering element after closing modals
- Manage focus for dynamic content

### 3. Landmark Regions
**Priority:** Medium
**Description:** Additional ARIA landmark roles for complex layouts
**Implementation:**
- Use `role="main"` for primary content areas
- Use `role="complementary"` for supplementary content
- Use `role="region"` with `aria-label` for distinct sections

### 4. Language Attributes
**Priority:** Low
**Description:** Proper `lang` attributes for multilingual content
**Implementation:**
- Add `lang` attribute to `<html>` element
- Add `lang` attribute to multilingual content sections

### 5. Enhanced Screen Reader Support

- Screen reader testing (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Color contrast verification with tools like WAVE
- Mobile accessibility testing with TalkBack

### Screen Reader Compatibility
- ✅ NVDA (Windows)
- ✅ JAWS (Windows)
- ✅ VoiceOver (macOS/iOS)
- ✅ TalkBack (Android)

## Conclusion

The MemoryKeeper application demonstrates strong accessibility foundations with proper semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and keyboard navigation support. The application meets most WCAG 2.1 AA requirements with a few areas for enhancement.

The identified improvements focus on advanced focus management, skip links, and enhanced screen reader support. Implementing these recommendations will further improve the accessibility experience for users with disabilities.

## Next Steps

1. Implement skip links for improved keyboard navigation
